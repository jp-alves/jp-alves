## Hi there, I'm João! 👋

### About Me 🌐
I am currently a Graduate Research Assistant at the [Institute of Energy and Environment, University of São Paulo](https://www.iee.usp.br/), where I'm pursuing my Masters in Energy with support from a scholarship provided by the [Brazilian National Agency for Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP)](https://www.gov.br/anp/en/access-information/what-is-anp/what-is-anp). My previous experience includes working on projects that integrate geophysical and geological data for fracking in the oil and gas. I'm interested in data science, geoscience, statistics, and industry related problems.

### Projects 🚀
- [ML Applied to Petrophysics](https://github.com/jp-alves/ml_basalts_ccs/tree/main): Application of machine learning methods for petrophysical prediction (density, porosity, and permeability) in basalts of the Serra Geral Group: Implications for carbon storage.
- [Magnetic Lineament Clustering](https://github.com/jp-alves/LineamentsJNB): Demonstrates the use of Jenks Natural Breaks for segmenting magnetic lineaments into structural families, coupled with statistical validation and geospatial visualization in Python.
- [SQL Murder Mystery](https://github.com/jp-alves/SQL_Murder_Mystery): Investigation case solved using SQL queries to analyze crime scene data across multiple database tables, demonstrating practical SQL analysis skills.
- [Brazilian Flights SQL Exploration](https://github.com/jp-alves/BrazilianFlightsSQL): SQL analysis of 14.7 M Brazilian flight legs (2000-2023) with DuckDB & Jupyter, revealing traffic growth, hub dominance, scheduling patterns, and delay hotspots.
- [Basalt Porosity-Permeability Modelling](https://github.com/jp-alves/RegressionPetro): End-to-end notebooks that cleans petrophysics data, fixes multicollinearity with Legendre polynomials, and delivers vp-porosity and porosity-permeability curves with uncertainty bands—critical for rapid CCS site screening in Paraná-Basin basalts.
- [Sentiment-Driven Stock Returns – PRIO3](https://github.com/jp-alves/prio3-sentiment): End-to-end analysis combining Portuguese news sentiment (FinBERT-PT-BR) with PRIO3 stock prices (2015–2024), featuring NLP, forward return modeling, violin plots, event-study curves, and Granger causality tests for financial signal discovery.
