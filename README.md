## Hi there, I'm João! 👋

### About Me 🌐
I am currently a Graduate Research Assistant at the [Institute of Energy and Environment, University of São Paulo](https://www.iee.usp.br/), where I'm pursuing my Masters in Energy with support from a scholarship provided by the [Brazilian National Agency for Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP)](https://www.gov.br/anp/en/access-information/what-is-anp/what-is-anp). My previous experience includes working on projects that integrate geophysical and geological data for fracking in the oil and gas. I'm interested in data science, geoscience, statistics, and industry related problems.
